SELECT owners.first_name, owners.last_name, owners.id, COUNT(*) AS total_cars FROM vehicles JOIN owners ON owners.id = vehicles.owner_id GROUP BY first_name, last_name, owners.id ORDER BY first_name;
-- ❓why do i have to group by owners.id and last_name if i am trying to order by first name?


SELECT owners.first_name, owners.last_name, owners.id, ROUND(AVG(vehicles.price)) AS average_price, COUNT(*) AS total_vehicles
FROM vehicles 
JOIN owners ON owners.id = vehicles.owner_id 
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, owners.id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND ROUND(AVG(vehicles.price)) > 10000;
-- ❓having works on aggregate conditions instead of WHERE?  i thought they could both filter results
